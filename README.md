I trained a LSTM model on the book _Call Me By Your Name_

## This is one of the output
"And I know it," I said, to say, Oliver, who had come with a hand his smile on the words that both didn't want to know 
how to last, I'd always had say this what I was happy, but that afternoon suddenly finally, I couldn't have been too long 
to get away him on the table, he saw his body would be the other. This was the first thing about San Clemente."

## About the lstm model
The model is simple, with one embedding layer, one lstm layer and a softmax output layer.   
The hyperparameters still need to adjust for the high loss at present.

## Environment
Python 3.5 or higher    
Tensorflow 1.0 or higher
